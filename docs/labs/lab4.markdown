This week we will be using data from Brad Gomez, Thomas Hansford and George Krause's work: (The Republicans Should Pray for Rain: Weather, Turnout, and Voting in U.S. Presidential Elections)[https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-2508.2007.00565.x]. Please make sure to read the paper before this week's lab.
